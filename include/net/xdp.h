/**
 * DOC: XDP RX-queue information
 *
 * The XDP RX-queue info (xdp_rxq_info) is associated with the driver
 * level RX-ring queues.  It is information that is specific to how
 * the driver have configured a given RX-ring queue.
 *
 * Each xdp_buff frame received in the driver carries a (pointer)
 * reference to this xdp_rxq_info structure.  This provides the XDP
 * data-path read-access to RX-info for both kernel and bpf-side
 * (limited subset).
 *
 * For now, direct access is only safe while running in NAPI/softirq
 * context.  Contents are read-mostly and must not be updated during
 * driver NAPI/softirq poll.
 *
 * The driver usage API is a register and unregister API.
 *
 * The struct is not directly tied to the XDP prog.  A new XDP prog
 * can be attached as long as it doesn't change the underlying
 * RX-ring.  If the RX-ring does change significantly, the NIC driver
 * naturally need to stop the RX-ring before purging and reallocating
 * memory.  In that process the driver MUST call unregister (which
 * also applies for driver shutdown and unload).  The register API is
 * also mandatory during RX-ring setup.

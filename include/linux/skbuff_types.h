/* The interface for checksum offload between the stack and networking drivers
 * is as follows...
 *
 * A. IP checksum related features
 *
 * Drivers advertise checksum offload capabilities in the features of a device.
 * From the stack's point of view these are capabilities offered by the driver.
 * A driver typically only advertises features that it is capable of offloading
 * to its device.
 *
 * The checksum related features are:
 *
 *	NETIF_F_HW_CSUM	- The driver (or its device) is able to compute one
 *			  IP (one's complement) checksum for any combination
 *			  of protocols or protocol layering. The checksum is
 *			  computed and set in a packet per the CHECKSUM_PARTIAL
 *			  interface (see below).
 *
 *	NETIF_F_IP_CSUM - Driver (device) is only able to checksum plain
 *			  TCP or UDP packets over IPv4. These are specifically
 *			  unencapsulated packets of the form IPv4|TCP or
 *			  IPv4|UDP where the Protocol field in the IPv4 header
 *			  is TCP or UDP. The IPv4 header may contain IP options.
 *			  This feature cannot be set in features for a device
 *			  with NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being
 *			  DEPRECATED (see below).
 *
 *	NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM - Driver (device) is only able to checksum plain
 *			  TCP or UDP packets over IPv6. These are specifically
 *			  unencapsulated packets of the form IPv6|TCP or
 *			  IPv6|UDP where the Next Header field in the IPv6
 *			  header is either TCP or UDP. IPv6 extension headers
 *			  are not supported with this feature. This feature
 *			  cannot be set in features for a device with
 *			  NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being
 *			  DEPRECATED (see below).
 *
 *	NETIF_F_RXCSUM - Driver (device) performs receive checksum offload.
 *			 This flag is only used to disable the RX checksum
 *			 feature for a device. The stack will accept receive
 *			 checksum indication in packets received on a device
 *			 regardless of whether NETIF_F_RXCSUM is set.
 *
 * B. Checksumming of received packets by device. Indication of checksum
 *    verification is set in skb->ip_summed. Possible values are:
 *
 * CHECKSUM_NONE:
 *
 *   Device did not checksum this packet e.g. due to lack of capabilities.
 *   The packet contains full (though not verified) checksum in packet but
 *   not in skb->csum. Thus, skb->csum is undefined in this case.
 *
 * CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY:
 *
 *   The hardware you're dealing with doesn't calculate the full checksum
 *   (as in CHECKSUM_COMPLETE), but it does parse headers and verify checksums
 *   for specific protocols. For such packets it will set CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY
 *   if their checksums are okay. skb->csum is still undefined in this case
 *   though. A driver or device must never modify the checksum field in the
 *   packet even if checksum is verified.
 *
 *   CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY is applicable to following protocols:
 *     TCP: IPv6 and IPv4.
 *     UDP: IPv4 and IPv6. A device may apply CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY to a
 *       zero UDP checksum for either IPv4 or IPv6, the networking stack
 *       may perform further validation in this case.
 *     GRE: only if the checksum is present in the header.
 *     SCTP: indicates the CRC in SCTP header has been validated.
 *     FCOE: indicates the CRC in FC frame has been validated.
 *
 *   skb->csum_level indicates the number of consecutive checksums found in
 *   the packet minus one that have been verified as CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.
 *   For instance if a device receives an IPv6->UDP->GRE->IPv4->TCP packet
 *   and a device is able to verify the checksums for UDP (possibly zero),
 *   GRE (checksum flag is set) and TCP, skb->csum_level would be set to
 *   two. If the device were only able to verify the UDP checksum and not
 *   GRE, either because it doesn't support GRE checksum or because GRE
 *   checksum is bad, skb->csum_level would be set to zero (TCP checksum is
 *   not considered in this case).
 *
 * CHECKSUM_COMPLETE:
 *
 *   This is the most generic way. The device supplied checksum of the _whole_
 *   packet as seen by netif_rx() and fills in skb->csum. This means the
 *   hardware doesn't need to parse L3/L4 headers to implement this.
 *
 *   Notes:
 *   - Even if device supports only some protocols, but is able to produce
 *     skb->csum, it MUST use CHECKSUM_COMPLETE, not CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.
 *   - CHECKSUM_COMPLETE is not applicable to SCTP and FCoE protocols.
 *
 * CHECKSUM_PARTIAL:
 *
 *   A checksum is set up to be offloaded to a device as described in the
 *   output description for CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. This may occur on a packet
 *   received directly from another Linux OS, e.g., a virtualized Linux kernel
 *   on the same host, or it may be set in the input path in GRO or remote
 *   checksum offload. For the purposes of checksum verification, the checksum
 *   referred to by skb->csum_start + skb->csum_offset and any preceding
 *   checksums in the packet are considered verified. Any checksums in the
 *   packet that are after the checksum being offloaded are not considered to
 *   be verified.
 *
 * C. Checksumming on transmit for non-GSO. The stack requests checksum offload
 *    in the skb->ip_summed for a packet. Values are:
 *
 * CHECKSUM_PARTIAL:
 *
 *   The driver is required to checksum the packet as seen by hard_start_xmit()
 *   from skb->csum_start up to the end, and to record/write the checksum at
 *   offset skb->csum_start + skb->csum_offset. A driver may verify that the
 *   csum_start and csum_offset values are valid values given the length and
 *   offset of the packet, but it should not attempt to validate that the
 *   checksum refers to a legitimate transport layer checksum -- it is the
 *   purview of the stack to validate that csum_start and csum_offset are set
 *   correctly.
 *
 *   When the stack requests checksum offload for a packet, the driver MUST
 *   ensure that the checksum is set correctly. A driver can either offload the
 *   checksum calculation to the device, or call skb_checksum_help (in the case
 *   that the device does not support offload for a particular checksum).
 *
 *   NETIF_F_IP_CSUM and NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM are being deprecated in favor of
 *   NETIF_F_HW_CSUM. New devices should use NETIF_F_HW_CSUM to indicate
 *   checksum offload capability.
 *   skb_csum_hwoffload_help() can be called to resolve CHECKSUM_PARTIAL based
 *   on network device checksumming capabilities: if a packet does not match
 *   them, skb_checksum_help or skb_crc32c_help (depending on the value of
 *   csum_not_inet, see item D.) is called to resolve the checksum.
 *
 * CHECKSUM_NONE:
 *
 *   The skb was already checksummed by the protocol, or a checksum is not
 *   required.
 *
 * CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY:
 *
 *   This has the same meaning as CHECKSUM_NONE for checksum offload on
 *   output.
 *
 * CHECKSUM_COMPLETE:
 *   Not used in checksum output. If a driver observes a packet with this value
 *   set in skbuff, it should treat the packet as if CHECKSUM_NONE were set.
 *
 * D. Non-IP checksum (CRC) offloads
 *
 *   NETIF_F_SCTP_CRC - This feature indicates that a device is capable of
 *     offloading the SCTP CRC in a packet. To perform this offload the stack
 *     will set csum_start and csum_offset accordingly, set ip_summed to
 *     CHECKSUM_PARTIAL and set csum_not_inet to 1, to provide an indication in
 *     the skbuff that the CHECKSUM_PARTIAL refers to CRC32c.
 *     A driver that supports both IP checksum offload and SCTP CRC32c offload
 *     must verify which offload is configured for a packet by testing the
 *     value of skb->csum_not_inet; skb_crc32c_csum_help is provided to resolve
 *     CHECKSUM_PARTIAL on skbs where csum_not_inet is set to 1.
 *
 *   NETIF_F_FCOE_CRC - This feature indicates that a device is capable of
 *     offloading the FCOE CRC in a packet. To perform this offload the stack
 *     will set ip_summed to CHECKSUM_PARTIAL and set csum_start and csum_offset
 *     accordingly. Note that there is no indication in the skbuff that the
 *     CHECKSUM_PARTIAL refers to an FCOE checksum, so a driver that supports
 *     both IP checksum offload and FCOE CRC offload must verify which offload
 *     is configured for a packet, presumably by inspecting packet headers.
 *
 * E. Checksumming on output with GSO.
 *
 * In the case of a GSO packet (skb_is_gso(skb) is true), checksum offload
 * is implied by the SKB_GSO_* flags in gso_type. Most obviously, if the
 * gso_type is SKB_GSO_TCPV4 or SKB_GSO_TCPV6, TCP checksum offload as
 * part of the GSO operation is implied. If a checksum is being offloaded
 * with GSO then ip_summed is CHECKSUM_PARTIAL, and both csum_start and
 * csum_offset are set to refer to the outermost checksum being offloaded
 * (two offloaded checksums are possible with UDP encapsulation).

/*
 * Packet hash types specify the type of hash in skb_set_hash.
 *
 * Hash types refer to the protocol layer addresses which are used to
 * construct a packet's hash. The hashes are used to differentiate or identify
 * flows of the protocol layer for the hash type. Hash types are either
 * layer-2 (L2), layer-3 (L3), or layer-4 (L4).
 *
 * Properties of hashes:
 *
 * 1) Two packets in different flows have different hash values
 * 2) Two packets in the same flow should have the same hash value
 *
 * A hash at a higher layer is considered to be more specific. A driver should
 * set the most specific hash possible.
 *
 * A driver cannot indicate a more specific hash than the layer at which a hash
 * was computed. For instance an L3 hash cannot be set as an L4 hash.
 *
 * A driver may indicate a hash level which is less specific than the
 * actual layer the hash was computed on. For instance, a hash computed
 * at L4 may be considered an L3 hash. This should only be done if the
 * driver can't unambiguously determine that the HW computed the hash at
 * the higher layer. Note that the "should" in the second property above
 * permits this.

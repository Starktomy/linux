 * The seqlock seqcount_t interface does not prescribe a precise sequence of

 * read_seqcount_begin() and read_seqcount_retry(), however, there are more
 * esoteric cases which do not follow this pattern.
 *
 * As a consequence, we take the following best-effort approach for raw usage
 * via seqcount_t under KCSAN: upon beginning a seq-reader critical section,
 * pessimistically mark the next KCSAN_SEQLOCK_REGION_MAX memory accesses as
 * atomics; if there is a matching read_seqcount_retry() call, no following
 * memory operations are considered atomic. Usage of the seqlock_t interface
 * is not affected.

/*
 * Sequence counters (seqcount_t)
 *
 * This is the raw counting mechanism, without any writer protection.
 *
 * Write side critical sections must be serialized and non-preemptible.
 *
 * If readers can be invoked from hardirq or softirq contexts,
 * interrupts or bottom halves must also be respectively disabled before
 * entering the write section.
 *
 * This mechanism can't be used if the protected data contains pointers,
 * as the writer can invalidate a pointer that a reader is following.
 *
 * If the write serialization mechanism is one of the common kernel
 * locking primitives, use a sequence counter with associated lock
 * (seqcount_LOCKNAME_t) instead.
 *
 * If it's desired to automatically handle the sequence counter writer
 * serialization and non-preemptibility requirements, use a sequential
 * lock (seqlock_t) instead.

 * lock. This will allow any possibly-preempted writer to make progress
